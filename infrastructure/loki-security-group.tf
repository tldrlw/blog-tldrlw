# By placing the Lambda function inside a VPC and attaching it to a security group, you gain the ability to restrict access to your Loki ECS container to only that Lambda function. This provides an additional layer of security, as your Loki ECS container will only accept traffic from specific, trusted sources.
# Controlled Access: By using security groups, you can tightly control which resources are allowed to communicate with your Loki ECS container, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
# Enhanced Security: Restricting ingress to the Loki ECS container from only the Lambda functionâ€™s security group is a best practice in secure cloud architecture, especially when handling sensitive data like logs.
